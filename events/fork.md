The fork event occurs when someone forks your repository into their account. Here are some key points to explain this event:

    The fork event is triggered when a user creates a fork of your repository.
    A fork is a copy of a repository that allows a user to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original repository.
    When the fork event occurs, you can configure workflows to perform certain actions, such as sending a notification or running a workflow on the forked repository.
    The fork event can be used to enforce certain policies, such as requiring pull requests to come from forks instead of direct branches.
    The fork event can also be used to track and manage forks of your repository.
