The delete event in GitHub is triggered when a branch, tag or repository is deleted. Here are the details of this event:

    When a branch or tag is deleted, it removes the associated ref from Git repository.
    When a repository is deleted, all the resources such as issues, pull requests, releases, and other associated data are also deleted permanently.
    This event is available only for organization-owned repositories or repositories where you're a collaborator with write access.
    The delete event payload includes details such as the name and type of resource that was deleted, and the user who triggered the deletion.
    You can use this event to automate actions based on deletions in your repository, for example, you can automatically close any associated issues or pull requests or remove references to the deleted resource.
