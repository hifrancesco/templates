The deployment_status event is triggered when the status of a deployment changes. Here are some key points to help explain this event:

    When a deployment is created or updated, the deployment_status event is triggered to indicate the initial status of the deployment.
    This event is then triggered again whenever the status of the deployment changes, such as when it is in progress, queued, or completed.
    The event payload includes information about the deployment, such as the ID, URL, and environment.
    It also includes the current state of the deployment, such as pending, success, failure, or error.
    You can use this event to trigger other actions in response to changes in the status of your deployments, such as sending notifications or updating external systems.

Here's an example of how you can listen for the deployment_status event in a GitHub Actions workflow:


```yml
on:
  deployment_status:
    types: [pending, success, failure]

jobs:
  handle-deployment-status:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Handle deployment status
        run: |
          echo "Deployment status: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.state }}"
          echo "Deployment URL: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}"
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered whenever the deployment_status event occurs with a state of pending, success, or failure. The handle-deployment-status job then runs and outputs information about the deployment status and URL.
