The gollum event in GitHub Actions is triggered when a Wiki page is created, edited, or deleted on a repository's wiki. Here are some bullet points to explain this event:

    The gollum event is named after the fictional character "Gollum" from J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" series, who is known for his obsession with a powerful artifact called the One Ring.
    When a Wiki page is created, edited, or deleted, the gollum event is triggered and can be used to run workflows in response to this activity.
    The gollum event provides information about the changes made to the Wiki, including the name and content of the updated pages.
    The gollum event can be used to automate tasks related to a repository's documentation, such as building and deploying a documentation website or notifying team members about changes to the Wiki.
    The gollum event is not triggered for changes made to a repository's code or issues and pull requests, as those have their own corresponding events in GitHub Actions.
