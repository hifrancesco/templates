- The `check_suite` event is triggered when a check suite is requested or completed.
- A check suite is a collection of related checks, such as multiple code analysis tools run against a single pull request.
- The `check_suite` event contains information about the check suite, including its ID, the SHA of the head commit, and the name of the branch that the head commit is in.
- The event also contains a repository object, which includes information about the repository that the check suite belongs to, such as the repository's name and owner.
- You can use the `check_suite` event to run a workflow that performs actions based on the result of the check suite. For example, you could automatically merge a pull request if all the checks in the check suite pass.
- The `check_suite` event can be used in combination with the `check_run` event, which provides information about individual checks within a check suite.
